Give one example.A specialized format for organizing and storing data (e.g., Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue).10NetworkingWhat is a subnet mask and what is it used for?A 32-bit number that separates the network address from the host address within an IP address.11ProgrammingWhat is a deadlock in concurrent programming?A situation where two or more processes are permanently blocked, waiting for each other to release resources.12DatabasesExplain the concept of a "JOIN" operation in SQL.A means of combining fields from two or more tables by using values common to each.13TheoryWhat is Moore's Law?The observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years.14NetworkingDescribe the difference between TCP and UDP.TCP is connection-oriented and reliable; UDP is connectionless and faster but less reliable.15ProgrammingWhat is an API (Application Programming Interface)?A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.16DatabasesWhat does ACID stand for in the context of database transactions?Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability17TheoryWhat is the purpose of a hash function?To map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size, often used for fast data lookups or security.18ProgrammingIn web development, what is the role of JavaScript compared to HTML and CSS?HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity and behavior.19NetworkingHow is IPv6 an improvement over IPv4?IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, providing a vastly larger address space than IPv4's 32-bit addresses.20TheoryWhat is Time Complexity and how is it commonly expressed?A measure of the time required to run an algorithm; commonly expressed using Big O notation.⛰️ Hard Level Questions (20)These questions require a deep understanding, the ability to synthesize concepts, and knowledge of complex algorithms or security principles.#TopicQuestionCorrect Answer1ProgrammingExplain the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface in an OOP context.Abstract classes can have implemented methods and member variables and are inherited; Interfaces define a contract of methods and are implemented.2TheoryDescribe the main problem that Paging solves in memory management and what Thrashing is.Paging allows non-contiguous memory allocation; Thrashing is excessive paging activity where the system spends more time swapping data than processing it.3NetworkingExplain the steps of the TLS/SSL Handshake process.Steps include: ClientHello, ServerHello, Certificate, Key Exchange (Server and Client), and Finished messages to establish an encrypted session.4DatabasesHow does an Index improve database performance, and what is the trade-off?It allows the database to quickly locate data without scanning the entire table. The trade-off is increased storage space and slower write (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) performance.5ProgrammingCompare and contrast the Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms in terms of average-case time complexity and stability.Both have $O(n \log n)$ average time complexity. Merge Sort is stable; Quick Sort is generally not stable.6TheoryWhat is the Halting Problem in computer science?The problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will eventually stop or continue to run forever (proven to be undecidable).7NetworkingDescribe a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack and distinguish it from a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.DoS attacks overwhelm a system from a single source; DDoS attacks use multiple, compromised computer systems (a botnet) to launch the attack.8DatabasesExplain the concept of Two-Phase Commit (2PC) in distributed databases.A protocol used to ensure that all participating nodes in a distributed transaction either commit or abort the transaction simultaneously.9ProgrammingWhat is the purpose of using a Design Pattern like the Singleton or Factory?To provide a proven, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design (Singleton ensures only one instance exists; Factory provides an interface for creating objects).10TheoryExplain the difference between symmetric-key and asymmetric-key cryptography.Symmetric uses the same key for encryption and decryption; Asymmetric uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.11NetworkingWhat is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and what layer of the OSI model does it primarily operate on?ARP resolves an IP address to a physical MAC address; it operates between the Data Link and Network Layers.12ProgrammingWhat is Garbage Collection and how does it prevent a common type of memory error?An automatic memory management process that identifies and frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks.13DatabasesWhat is the difference between a Clustered Index and a Non-Clustered Index?Clustered index physically sorts the data in the table (one per table); Non-clustered index stores the index separate from the data, pointing to the data location (multiple per table).14TheoryDescribe Virtualization and how a Hypervisor facilitates it.Virtualization is creating a virtual version of a resource (like an OS). A Hypervisor is the software/firmware that creates and runs the Virtual Machines (VMs).15ProgrammingWhat is the CAP Theorem in distributed systems?States that a distributed data store can only simultaneously guarantee Consistency, Availability, or Partition Tolerance—it can only achieve two out of three.16NetworkingExplain the function of a Firewall and the difference between Packet-Filtering and Stateful Inspection.A firewall controls incoming/outgoing network traffic. Packet-filtering checks headers only; Stateful Inspection tracks the state of active connections.17TheoryWhat are the main components of the Turing Machine?Tape (infinite memory), Head (reads/writes/moves), State Register (stores current state), and Table of Instructions (finite set of rules).18DatabasesDefine Transaction Isolation Levels (e.g., Read Committed, Serializable) and why they are important.They define how/when the changes made by one transaction become visible to other concurrent transactions, preventing concurrency problems (like dirty reads).19ProgrammingExplain Polymorphism in OOP, specifically overloading versus overriding.Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. Overloading is defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters; Overriding is providing a new implementation for a method inherited from a parent class.20TheoryWhat is the concept of Race Condition in operating systems and how can it be avoided?A situation where the output of a concurrent process depends on the unpredictable sequence of events (order of execution). It is avoided using synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or mutexes. Make the mode board in cyberpunk
